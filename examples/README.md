# MatterVial Examples

This directory contains example scripts and demonstrations of MatterVial's capabilities.

## Available Examples

### `multi_layer_featurizers_demo.py`
Demonstrates the multi-layer featurizer functionality:
- Shows how to use MVLFeaturizer and AdjacentMEGNetFeaturizer with multiple layers
- Tests backward compatibility with single-layer configurations
- Displays available featurizers and their status
- Provides interface testing for different configurations

**Key Features Demonstrated:**
- Multi-layer feature extraction (combining layer32 and layer16)
- Backward compatibility with existing single-layer code
- Error handling and availability checking
- Custom configuration options

### `orb_featurizer_demo.py`
Demonstrates ORB (Orbital-based Representation) featurizer usage:
- Shows how to set up and use the ORB featurizer
- Tests ORB model availability and environment requirements
- Demonstrates feature extraction from crystal structures
- Includes performance benchmarking capabilities

**Key Features Demonstrated:**
- ORB model initialization and configuration
- Structure preparation and featurization
- Environment dependency checking
- GPU/CPU device selection

### `orb_consistency_test.py`
Tests consistency and reproducibility of ORB featurizer:
- Validates that ORB features are consistent across runs
- Tests different precision modes and device configurations
- Ensures reproducibility of results
- Benchmarks performance across different settings

### `orb_performance_benchmark.py`
Benchmarks ORB featurizer performance:
- Measures featurization speed for different dataset sizes
- Compares GPU vs CPU performance
- Tests memory usage and scalability
- Provides timing analysis for optimization

## Usage Instructions

### Running the Examples

```bash
# Navigate to the examples directory
cd examples/

# Run multi-layer featurizer demo
python multi_layer_featurizers_demo.py

# Run ORB featurizer demo (requires ORB environment)
conda activate env_orb
python orb_featurizer_demo.py

# Run ORB consistency test
python orb_consistency_test.py

# Run ORB performance benchmark
python orb_performance_benchmark.py
```

### Environment Requirements

Different examples require different conda environments:

- **multi_layer_featurizers_demo.py**: Primary environment (`env_primary`)
- **orb_*.py scripts**: ORB environment (`env_orb`)

Make sure to activate the appropriate environment before running each example.

## Creating Custom Examples

When creating new examples, follow these patterns:

### Basic Structure
```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
"""
Example script demonstrating [specific functionality].
"""

def main():
    """Main demonstration function."""
    print("=== Your Example Title ===")
    
    try:
        # Import MatterVial components
        import mattervial.featurizers
        
        # Your demonstration code here
        
    except ImportError as e:
        print(f"Import error: {e}")
        print("Please check your environment setup.")
        return
    
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error during demonstration: {e}")
        return

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

### Error Handling
Always include proper error handling for:
- Import errors (missing dependencies)
- Environment issues (wrong conda environment)
- Data loading problems
- Model availability issues

### Documentation
Include clear docstrings and comments explaining:
- What the example demonstrates
- Required environment/dependencies
- Expected output
- Common issues and solutions

## Common Issues and Solutions

### Import Errors
```python
# Check featurizer availability
import mattervial.featurizers
available = mattervial.featurizers.get_available_featurizers()
print("Available featurizers:", available)
```

### Environment Issues
```python
# Check if specific featurizer is available
try:
    from mattervial.featurizers import ORBFeaturizer
    orb = ORBFeaturizer()
    print("ORB featurizer available")
except ImportError as e:
    print(f"ORB not available: {e}")
    print("Please activate the ORB environment: conda activate env_orb")
```

### Model File Issues
```python
# Check for required model files
import os
model_path = "./MEGNetModel__adjacent.h5"
if not os.path.exists(model_path):
    print(f"Model file not found: {model_path}")
    print("Please train the adjacent model first.")
```
